    <h1>My impromptu plan to pursue MS</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        So it was the peak COVID time in 2019 and it was already one year since
        I completed my undergrad. I was sitting with my family discussing
        various career options with my mom and dad. It had always been my
        mother's dream that someday I go to the US to pursue a Master's and land
        a job there, and so my mom all of a sudden raised this topic in front of
        my dad. My dad wasn't so convinced about this decision. Although I
        wasn't against this idea, so I agreed with my mom. It took a little
        effort to persuade my dad for this but we were able to do so in the end.

        Within one month, I prepared for the GRE, took the GRE, and could apply
        to a total of only 3 universities, since the application deadlines for
        most of the universities were already over. Some universities including
        Stevens extended their deadlines due to the pandemic. I got a call from
        Stevens, got my visa, and boom.....I was in the US within one month of
        my decision.
